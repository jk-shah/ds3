DVD Store 3 (DS3) is an open source test / benchmark tool
that simultaes an online store that sells DVDs. Customers 
can login, browse DVDs, browse reviews of DVDs, create
new reviews, rate reviews, become premium members, and 
purchase DVDs. Everything needed to create, load, and stress

DVD Store 3 is based on the previous DVD Store 2.  The new 
features in DVD Store 3 revolve around the addition of 
customer reviews and premium membership. 

This is a database test workload. The database is created
using the included tools and then stressed with the included
driver program that simultes user activity.

Full details are included in the various readme files in the
DS3 subdirectories.

DVD Store 3 will support Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, and
PostgreSQL databases when complete.  

As of this update in July 2015, Oracle and MySQL support is
